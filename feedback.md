# Termagotchi

I love this so much - its really just too cute. The ascii art is just :chefs-kiss:. I kind of want to use this as the deliverable for next module's terminal app lesson. Here's some general notes / feedback but overall, great job this week! 

- great job researching different terminal libraries
- really impressed with your work with promises in this app -- i know that was all new syntax for you so great job figuring it out during a project week
- Think about refactoring some functions from index.js into separate files just to keep the code a little shorter / cleaner
- You could think about completely removing the express server to be honest, and just connecting directly to your database -- I don't think you really need the API right now -- instead of funneling through the API, you could just call the Model methods directly in your utils
- Code is really clean & easy to read - nice work!
